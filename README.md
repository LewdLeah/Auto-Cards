# Auto-Cards
Made by LewdLeah ❤️
## Overview
Auto-Cards is a plug-and-play script for AI Dungeon that watches your story and automatically writes plot-relevant story cards during normal gameplay. My primary goal was to address the "object permanence problem" by extending story cards and memories with deeper automation. Auto-Cards builds a living reference of your adventure's world as you go.
## Main Features
- Object permanence! (sort of)
- Simple and easy to use, full background automation allows you to focus on gameplay
- Detects named entities from your story and periodically writes new cards
- Smart long-term memory updates and summaries for important cards
- Fully customizable AI card generation and memory summarization prompts
- Suitable for both free and premium AI Dungeon users alike
- Optional in-game commands to manually direct the card generation process
- Optional in-game scripting interface (LSIv2)
- Optional API for other creators to use
## Permission
Auto-Cards is both free and open source for anyone to use within their own scenarios or scripts, even including published works. General-purpose usefulness and compatibility were my top design priorities. You have my full permission to use, copy, or modify Auto-Cards. Please enjoy! ❤️
