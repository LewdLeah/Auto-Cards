# Auto-Cards
Auto-Cards is a plug-and-play script for AI Dungeon that watches your story and automatically writes plot-relevant story cards during normal gameplay. A forgetful AI breaks my immersion, therefore my primary goal was to address the "object permanence problem" by extending story cards and memories with deeper automation. Auto-Cards builds a living reference of your adventure's world as you go.
